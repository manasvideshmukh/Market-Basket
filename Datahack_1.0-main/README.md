## 🎉 Welcome to our amazing project! 🎉

This project was created as part of a 24-hour datathon 🏆, **Datahack 1.0**, where we put our skills to the test and built something awesome! 😎

## 📂 Project Structure:
The project consists of three Jupyter Notebooks:

(I) "DataHack_PreProcessing.ipynb":
In this notebook, we pre-process the dataset to get it ready for analysis. We check for missing values, remove rows with negative values, and eliminate unnecessary columns. We also perform label encoding on certain columns to ensure relevant data is used for further analysis.

(II) "Datahack_FeatureSelection.ipynb":
Here, we create a cluster for the "order_id" column to group similar items ordered by customers. This allows for more meaningful analysis.

(III) "Datahack_Model.ipynb":
In this notebook, we leverage the power of the Apriori algorithm for data mining. This algorithm identifies frequent itemsets in the dataset, helping us make predictions based on user input.

**🤖 ChatBot:**
To recommend the food item that most customers prefer based on a given food item, we use collaborative filtering. This technique predicts preferences by analyzing the preferences of similar users. To build an effective recommendation system, significant data and resources are required.

**🌐 Website:**
Our project also includes a static website where we showcase information about the restaurants. You'll also find our ChatBot integrated into the website for a seamless user experience.
